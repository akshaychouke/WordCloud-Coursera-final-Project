# WordCloud-Coursera-final-Project
This project was done when I was learning python from Coursera which was offered by Google.

<h2> Problem Statment</h2>

<h4>For this project, you'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that
do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function.
The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.</h4>
